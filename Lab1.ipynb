Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).  In addition to Python and many other programming languages, iPython notebook supports adding Markdown to make your code and analysis easy to follow.  To insert Markdown into your ipython notebook press the \"ESC\" key twice and then press \"m\". When you are finished, press \"Shift+Enter\" to render the markdown code into text."
